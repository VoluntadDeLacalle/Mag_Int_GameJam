Hello young Junker Bot, what brings you to these parts? What's that? You want to help
fix the Sorting Yard?~
Well, good luck with that. I'm sure you've noticed that I seem to be standing on
one leg at the moment. That's not no optical illusion.~
No, ya see, all of use bots have camouflage plating built in to our systems. One day
the workers felt a surge of some kind and now we're all out of wack!~
I need you to climb this here crane to my right. You'll need to find one of the old
Grabbers we have laying around and fix it up. Return to me once you do so.
