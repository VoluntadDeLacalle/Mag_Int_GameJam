Right, so that there is a Grabber. To use it, simply have the end collide with what
you want to grab and press the <i>Left Mouse Button</i>. Press the same button to drop
the grabbed object.~
The grabber has a limit, it can't carry anything too heavy, so don't go trying to swing it
at everything!~
Now go find the source of that power surge! I'm gonna work on getting this here door open.
