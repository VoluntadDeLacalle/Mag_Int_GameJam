Let's see... Looks like we've got ourselves a mighty fine JD unit. Modules seem to be intact...~
Wait! Is that a <b><color=#ffa500ff>chassis</color></b>? Well that's just what I needed!~
Looks like your <b><color=#ffa500ff>chassis</color></b> is a bit broken though. You could repair that real easy, ya'know? 
All you gotta do is take some scrap and press '<i>Q</i>' on yer internal keyboard and 
find the restoration button in yer inventory!
