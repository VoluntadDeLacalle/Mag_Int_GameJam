Let's see... Looks like we're got ourselves a mighty fine JD unit. Modules seem to be intact...~
Wait! Is that a <b>chassis</b>? Well that's just what I needed!~
Looks like your chassis's a bit broken though. You could repair that real easy, ya'know? 
All you gotta do is take some scrap and press '<i>Q</i>' on yer internal keyboard and 
find the restoration button in yer inventory!
