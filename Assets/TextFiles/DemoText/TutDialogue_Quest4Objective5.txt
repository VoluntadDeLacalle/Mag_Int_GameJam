Well cut my legs off and call me shorty! <size=24>Don't do that.</size> You done survived! 
In truth, I'm quite shocked. The last four droids I sent on that mission...~
Well, I'll just bet that was a mighty hefty <b>scrap</b> pile ya found.~
Anyway, as promised you can keep that <b>pole grip</b>, won't be needin' it anymore. And what's 
that? You found yer self a glowing <b>effector</b>? Let me see that~
My my, that's a lot of energy. I can feel it surging through my fingers. I do wonder...~
I'm sure you remember why we're all still stuck in this rocky pit don't cha? Ever since the generator
from our sector lost power, we've been right cut off from the rest of the planet.~
Now, I ain't no betting bot, ain't got the up-to-date RNG rigs for it, but if you were to take 
that there... <b>power effector</b>, I'll calls it, and use it on the generator... Well, you 
could be our savior!~
I, myself, have been itchin' to get out of these walls. Especially after that big Ol' explosion I done heard this morning 
just on the other side.~
<size=24>Maybe its the <b>War</b> startin' again!</size>~
You go on ahead and see if ya can get that gate open. And, well,~
Good luck, JD unit. See ya around.
