Pretty neat yeah? I hear there are all sorts of <b><color=#ffa500ff>components</color></b> out there - some maybe more useful than others. 
'Course, there are <b><color=#ffa500ff>grips</color></b> too, like this mighty fine <b><color=#ffa500ff>pole grip</color></b> that's keeping me up.~

Now, about that proposition I done mentioned before.~
You surely know by now that any random <b><color=#ffa500ff>scrap</color></b> you collect from this wasteland is kept stated in yer <b><color=#ffa500ff>inventory</color></b>. 
<size=24>You can press '<i>Q</i>' if you done forgot how to access that already.</size>~
Well, it just so happens that the lower left side of my body is in need of some <b><color=#ffa500ff>scrap</color></b>. 
It'd sure be nice if some droid with two, mechanically functioning, legs would help me out.~
...~
That'd be you, sunshine.~
If yer up for the task, I seem to recall a giant pile of junk out past an old mine field. Now, you know how 
them mines are, so I suggest you use that <b><color=#ffa500ff>effector</color></b> I gave you earlier.~
Hey, just to sweeten the deal, hows about I give you my <b><color=#ffa500ff>pole grip</color></b>. Think of it as an incentive to return to me... alive.~
Equip it just like you did that <b><color=#ffa500ff>effector</color></b> earlier. It'll change your programmed stance once you 
activate it with the button on your <i>right mouse</i> unit.~
Oh, name's <b><color=#ffa500ff>Tut</color></b> by the way; you probably already knew that 
cause of our "fancy hardware". Either way, much obliged.~
Now get! I wanna <size=24>get... </size><size=20>back to work...</size>
