Pretty neat yeah? I hear there are all sorts of <b>components</b> out there - some maybe more useful than others. 
'Course, there are <b>grips</b> too, like this mighty fine <b>pole grip</b> that's keeping me up.~

Now, about that proposition I done mentioned before.~
You surely know by now that any random <b>scrap</b> you collect from this wasteland is kept stated in yer <b>inventory</b>. 
<size=24>You can press '<i>Q</i>' if you done forgot how to access that already.</size>~
Well, it just so happens that the lower left side of my body is in need of some <b>scrap</b>. 
It'd sure be nice if some droid with two, mechanically functioning, legs would help me out.~
...~
That'd be you, sunshine.~
If yer up for the task, I seem to recall a giant pile of junk out past an old mine field. Now, you know how 
them mines are, so I suggest you use that <b>effector</b> I gave you earlier.~
Hey, just to sweeten the deal, hows about I give you my <b>pole grip</b>. Think of it as an incentive to return to me... alive.~
Equip it just like you did that <b>effector</b> earlier. It'll change your programmed stance once you 
activate it with the button on your <i>right mouse</i> unit.~
Oh, name's <b>Tut</b> by the way, much obliged. Now get! I wanna <size=28>get... </size><size=24>back to work...</size>
