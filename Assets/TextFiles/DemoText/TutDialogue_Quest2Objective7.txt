<size=24>Not that it did me much good anyhow...</size>~
You can combine the two of them items by <b>craftin'</b>.~

Ya'know... <b>crafting</b>??~
... <size=24>Guess you might have a few screws loose.</size>~
You can <b>craft</b> by calling the '<i>C</i>' button on yer internal keyboard. You can combine all sorts of 
items; <b>chassis</b>, <b>effectors</b>, <size=24><b>ammo</b></size>, and <b>grips</b> just to name a few.~
Most effectors can be activated by clicking the button on yer <i>left mouse</i> unit. Some may 
take a single touch, while others will need you to hold. Go ahead and try it out.~
Talk to me when yer done, I've gots a proposition for ya. <size=24>Take as long as you like, I'll just be rustin' away.</size>
